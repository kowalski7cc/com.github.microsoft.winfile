            <p>WinFile v10.0 - Sharing 10 years of improvements</p>
            <p>The master branch contains changes I have made since 2007. The changes have been
                solely determined by my needs and
                personal use. Some of the changes have limitations that fit the way I use the tool.
                For example, the path index
                which supports the new goto command only contains information for the c: drive.</p>
            <p>I have also not redesigned or restructured WinFile in any major way.</p>
            <p>Version v10.0 represents the entire set of changes from Nov. 2007 until this OSS
                project was created. For changes
                post v10.0, see the commit and release history.</p>
            <p>In summary v10.0 has the following changes/new features compared to original_plus:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>OLE drag/drop support</li>
                <li>control characters (e.g., ctrl+C) map to current short cut (e.g., ctrl+c ->
                    copy) instead of changing drives
                </li>
                <li>cut (ctrl+X) followed by paste (ctrl+V) translates into a file move as one would
                    expect</li>
                <li>left and right arrows in the tree view expand and collapse folders like in the
                    Explorer</li>
                <li>added context menus in both panes</li>
                <li>improved the means by which icons are displayed for files</li>
                <li>F12 runs notepad or notepad++ on the selected file</li>
                <li>moved the ini file location to %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\WinFile</li>
                <li>File.Search can include a date which limits the files returned to those after
                    the date provided; the output is
                    also sorted by the date instead of by the name</li>
                <li>File.Search includes an option as to whether to include sub-directories</li>
                <li>ctrl+K starts a command shell (ConEmu if installed) in the current directory;
                    shfit+ctrl+K starts an elevated
                    command shell (cmd.exe only)</li>
                <li>File.Goto (ctrl+G) enables one to type a few words of a path and get a list of
                    directories; selecting one
                    changes to that directory. Only drive c: is indexed.</li>
                <li>UI shows reparse points (e.g., Junction points) as such</li>
                <li>added simple forward / back navigation (probably needs to be improved)</li>
                <li>View command has a new option to sort by date forward (oldest on top); normal
                    date sorting is newest on top</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can read the code for more details.</p>
